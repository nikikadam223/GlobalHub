Regulatory bodies across the globe are imposing more stringent accessibility requirements on digital platforms, and failure to comply can result in penalties and lawsuits. Moreover, with the rise of mobile internet usage and digital content consumption, there is an even greater need for websites, applications, and digital products to be accessible to people with disabilities.</p> <p>Another significant factor contributing to the market expansion is the growing awareness of the social impact of digital exclusion. Consumers and stakeholders are placing greater importance on brands that prioritize inclusivity and diversity, which drives companies to adopt accessibility testing solutions as part of their corporate responsibility strategies. Moreover, the integration of machine learning (ML) and AI in accessibility testing tools is improving the efficiency and accuracy of audits, thereby reducing testing times and improving the user experience for people with disabilities.</p> <p>Geographically, North America holds the largest share of the accessibility testing services market due to the stringent regulatory environment and early adoption of accessibility standards.
